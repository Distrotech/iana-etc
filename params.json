In future,\r\n    other such files may be added.\r\n\r\n    Included are snapshots of the data from the IANA, scripts to transform that\r\n    data into the needed formats, and scripts to fetch the latest data.\r\n\r\n    Maintainer: Seth W. Klein <sk@sethwklein.net>\r\n    Home Page: http://www.sethwklein.net/projects/iana-etc/\r\n\r\n    Bug reports and patches are welcome.\r\n\r\nPORT ALIASES\r\n\r\n    Please report any additional port aliases that you need. The port-aliases\r\n    file contains the current list.  To minimize cruft, it includes only\r\n    aliases for which there has been reported need. \r\n\r\n    If you need an alias that isn't included, you may see the error:\r\n\r\n\tgetaddrinfo: Servname not supported for ai_socktype\r\n\r\n    Some useful things for finding out what alias is needed:\r\n      * strace from <http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~wichert/strace/>\r\n      * grep -r 'getaddrinfo' in the appropriate source tree\r\n\r\n    The various RFCs and such usually list the number for an alias but it may\r\n    be faster to just check the FreeBSD services file at\r\n    <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/etc/services>.\r\n\r\n    Bug reports and patches are welcome at the maintainer address listed above.\r\n\r\nDEPENDENCIES\r\n\r\n    GNU Awk 3.1.0 or Later\r\n\tNumerous GNU Awk extensions are used.  Awk was chosen over Perl for\r\n\tits smaller size and more flexible installation process both of which\r\n\tare important in a bootstrap environment.\r\n\r\n\tVersion 3.1.0 or later is required for support of the third argument\r\n\tto match().  The workaround to support older versions would be less\r\n\treadable and slower so I'd rather not include it without good reason.\r\n\r\n\tLike GNU Awk before 3.1.0, Mawk doesn't support three argument match()\r\n\tand so is not supported.  It also doesn't support network extensions.\r\n\r\n    Make\r\n\tTesting is only done with GNU Make but incompatibilities with other\r\n\tmake implementations are bugs. Please send patches.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\n    The installation process is flexible and friendly to unattended install-\r\n    ation even though, due to its simplicity, it does not use Autoconf.\r\n\r\n    For basic installation run:\r\n\r\n\tmake\r\n\tsu\r\n\tmake install\r\n\r\n    This creates /etc/services and /etc/protocols without using internet\r\n    access.\r\n\r\n    To throw out the useful comments in generated files (useful for embedded\r\n    installations), use:\r\n\r\n\tmake STRIP=yes\r\n\r\n    To install to a temporary location as package managers often do, use\r\n    DESTDIR like this:\r\n\r\n\tmake DESTDIR=/mnt/tmp install\r\n\r\n    This will create /mnt/tmp/etc/services and /mnt/tmp/etc/protocols.\r\n\r\n    PREFIX is also supported but currently does the same thing as DESTDIR.\r\n\r\n    For unusual installations,\r\n\r\n\tmake DESTDIR=/tmp PREFIX=/foo ETC_DIR=/bar install\r\n\r\n    will create /tmp/foo/bar/services and /tmp/foo/bar/protocols.\r\n\r\nGETTING FRESH DATA\r\n\r\n    This process is not advised for unattended installations.  See below.\r\n    To fetch the latest data from the IANA run:\r\n\r\n\tmake get\r\n\tmake\r\n\tmake test\r\n\t# Visually inspect protocols and services because some errors\r\n\t# could produce a file that is valid but contains no records.\r\n\r\n    Beware that while test checks for invalid lines in the output files,\r\n    it cannot check for applications that might be broken by changes made\r\n    by the IANA or breakage that makes the file valid but not useful.  In\r\n    addition, there is generally little of interest in the IANA's changes\r\n    unless you're trying to pick a port for new development in which case\r\n    you're better off consulting the unfiltered files.\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\n    Man pages are provided by the man-pages package. See\r\n    http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages/ and\r\n    http://freshmeat.net/projects/man-pages/\r\n\r\nBUGS\r\n\r\n    The Makefile uses the .PHONY target which (according to the GNU Make\r\n    info page, IIRC) is not supported by other common make implementations.  \r\n    There are plans to fix this in a future release.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
